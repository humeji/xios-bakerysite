# Theme Packaging Workflow

Before creating a new ZIP bundle, ALL prerequisites in [`scripts/README.md`](../../scripts/README.md) must be satisfied. This includes:

1. All unit tests passing (`npm test`)
2. SonarQube reporting zero findings on all changed files
3. All documentation being current (TASK.md, PLANNING.md, plan docs, README)
4. ZIP naming convention followed: `xios-bakery-theme-<plan-id>-<YYYYMMDD>.zip`

Always consult `scripts/README.md` for the authoritative checklist and usage instructions.
