# Plan-Scoped Documentation

Every Cursor plan that modifies theme code must have a matching documentation folder under `docs/plans/<plan-id>/`.

## Required Structure

```
docs/plans/<plan-id>/
├── README.md             # Required -- high-level record of what was delivered
├── ...                   # Additional docs as needed (SOWs, guides, etc.)
```

## When Applying Changes to a Plan

1. **Create the plan folder** if it does not already exist: `docs/plans/<plan-id>/`
2. **Create or update README.md** with:
   - Objective (what the plan set out to do)
   - What was delivered (list of features/fixes)
   - Files modified
   - Bundles produced
   - Open items (if any)
3. **Create supporting docs** as needed (SOWs, deployment guides, configuration guides)
4. **Update `CHANGELOG.md`** (project root) with an entry for the new version once bundled

## When Plan Scope Changes

If requirements change mid-plan (new edge cases, localization, etc.):

1. Update the plan's `README.md` to reflect the new deliverables
2. Update or create any affected supporting docs in the plan folder

## Document Naming

- Plan-specific docs go in `docs/plans/<plan-id>/`
- General project docs (not tied to any plan) stay in `docs/`
- Each plan's README.md is the single source of truth for what that plan delivered

## Cross-References

When referencing plan docs from other files (README, PLANNING.md, etc.), use the full relative path:

```
docs/plans/bakery_checkout_minimum_fix_730f7d42/README.md
```
