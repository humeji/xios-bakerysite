# Plan Kickoff -- Required Review

Before writing any code for a new Cursor plan in this project, review these files to understand what has already been built, the project's security posture, development workflow, and CI configuration:

## 1. `CHANGELOG.md`

Read the full changelog to understand the current theme version, what was shipped in every prior bundle, and the overall version progression. This prevents duplicating work that was already delivered or introducing changes that conflict with prior releases.

## 2. `docs/plans/`

Review the README.md in each completed plan folder under `docs/plans/<plan-id>/`. These contain objectives, deliverables, files modified, and open items from prior plans. Understanding what was previously delivered and any open items is essential context for scoping new work effectively.

## 3. `PLANNING.md`

Review architecture, conventions, and constraints so new work aligns with existing patterns.

## 4. `.github/DEVELOPMENT.md`

Review the development workflow, testing requirements, SonarQube quality gate, and packaging checklist. All plans must follow these steps.

## 5. `.github/SECURITY.md`

Review the known vulnerability list and current remediation status. New plans must not reintroduce resolved issues or ignore documented security constraints.

## 6. `.github/workflows/`

Read all files in this directory. Currently contains:

- `ci.yml` -- CI pipeline that runs Jest tests and ESLint/SonarJS on every push and PR. All new code must pass this gate.
- `release.yml` -- Release pipeline triggered by version tags (`v*`). Runs tests + lint, packages the theme ZIP, and creates a GitHub Release. Production bundles come exclusively from this workflow.
