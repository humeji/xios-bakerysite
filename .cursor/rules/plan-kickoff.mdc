# Plan Kickoff -- Required Review

Before writing any code for a new Cursor plan in this project, review these files to understand the project's security posture, development workflow, and CI configuration:

## 1. `.github/workflows/`

Read all files in this directory. Currently contains:

- `security.yml.example` -- Semgrep and dependency-check CI pipeline template. Understand what security scanning is configured (or planned) so new code does not introduce patterns that would fail these checks.

## 2. `.github/SECURITY.md`

Review the known vulnerability list and current remediation status. New plans must not reintroduce resolved issues or ignore documented security constraints.

## 3. `.github/DEVELOPMENT.md`

Review the development workflow, testing requirements, SonarQube quality gate, and packaging checklist. All plans must follow these steps.

## 4. `PLANNING.md`

Review architecture, conventions, and constraints so new work aligns with existing patterns.

## 5. `TASK.md`

Read the most recent entries to understand what was last delivered and avoid conflicts or rework.
