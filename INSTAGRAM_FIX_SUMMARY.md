## Problems Fixed

### 1. Instagram Feed Was Not Loading
The Instagram section on the homepage was broken and not displaying any content. Visitors could not see the bakery's Instagram posts.

### 2. Instagram Feed Was Too Small on Desktop
After fixing the loading issue, the Instagram feed appeared much smaller than the product sections above it, creating an inconsistent look on desktop browsers.

## What Was Done

- Fixed the Instagram embed code so the feed now loads and displays properly
- Adjusted the sizing so the Instagram section better matches the width of other page sections
- Updated the website theme files to support the new layout
- Tested on both desktop and mobile views
- Deployed all changes to the live website

## Result

The Instagram feed on [xiosbakery.com](https://xiosbakery.com) now:
- Loads correctly and shows the latest posts from [@xios.bakery](https://www.instagram.com/xios.bakery/)
- Automatically updates when new posts are added to Instagram (no manual updates needed)
- Displays properly on both desktop and mobile devices
