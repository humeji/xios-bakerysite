## Problem

The Instagram feed on the Xio's Bakery homepage was **completely broken**. The @xios.bakery Instagram posts were **not loading or displaying at all** - visitors only saw an empty section where the Instagram content should have been.

Additionally, once fixed, the feed needed sizing adjustments to better fit the page layout on desktop view.

## What Was Done

1. **Fixed the broken Instagram embed** - Replaced the faulty code with working embed code so the Instagram posts now load and display correctly

2. **Improved the layout** - Adjusted sizing so the Instagram section fits better with the rest of the homepage

3. **Updated website theme** - Applied necessary changes to support the fix

4. **Deployed to live site** - All changes are now live on xiosbakery.com

## Result

- Instagram posts from @xios.bakery now load and display on the homepage
- The feed automatically updates whenever new posts are added to Instagram
- Works on both desktop and mobile devices
